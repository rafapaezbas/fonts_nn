			<p>FontCombo! is a learning weekend project that uses a neural network algorithm trying to learn pleasant font combinations. The code of the neural network is the open source library<a href="https://github.com/CodingTrain/Toy-Neural-Network-JS">Toy-Neural-Network-JS.</a>Special thanks to Daniel Shiffman for being an inspiration since a long time ago.</p>
			<h2>How does this work?</h2>
			<p>It is actually really simple. In the home page you can see a text with a random combination of two different fonts. Press the like button or unlike button and that will send that info to the neural network that is going to learn from that and modify itself. If you click on the suggestions link, the algorithm will try to give you a combination o fonts that thinks its right.</p>
			<p>Remember, the more trained the neural network is, the better results it will output. So if the suggestions are not good enough, just keep on training it!.<p>
